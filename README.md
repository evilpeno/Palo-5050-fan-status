# Palo-5050-fan-status
A nagios plugin that returns a multiline response for palo alto 5050 firewall fan status.


I couldn't find a good one that did this, so I built it. It's a lot of snmp table parsing, but it works. No idea if it will work on other palo's, I don't have access to those. Works on mine though.
